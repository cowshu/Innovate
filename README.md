# Welcome to my silly modpack!
I only know this pack works with Prism Launcher, but you can try other launchers. The setup guide is tailored for Prism Launcher.
### Setup:
1. Download the pack (in Releases, on the right of this page)
2. Install prism if you havent already (https://prismlauncher.org)
3. Install Adoptium's JDK 17 (Click Latest LTS Release here: https://adoptium.net)
4. Import the pack to Prism Launcher (Open prism, click Add Instance, click Import from Zip, click "Browse", and select the .zip file you downloaded from this GitHub repo (Downloads folder))
5. Once its done importing, click "Edit" on the right pane of the Prism Launcher window and click the "Settings" tab
6. Click "Auto-detect" and select any item on the list that says its version is 17.x.x.
7. Save, and launch the pack when you're ready. The SMP is already in the multiplayer tab!
